Dear All,



As today marks my last working day at TATA Consultancy Services, I find myself reflecting on the incredible journey we’ve shared over the past 10.5 years. It’s been an honor to grow both professionally and personally alongside such talented, supportive, and inspiring individuals.  

I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I’ve had here—the challenges that pushed me to grow, the collaborations that enriched my perspective. A special thank you to [mention specific teams, managers, or colleagues if appropriate] for your guidance, trust, and camaraderie.  

I also want to acknowledge the smooth transition process and the kindness shown during my release—it truly reflects the values this organization stands for. While I’m excited for the next chapter, I will dearly miss being part of this team.  


Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for making this decade so memorable. Wishing you all continued growth and happiness!
